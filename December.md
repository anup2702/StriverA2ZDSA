# 📅 **December DSA Plan (Fast Pace — Starting 06 Dec)**

December focus = **High-ROI topics → Recursion → Graphs → DP → Trees clean-up → Leftovers**.

Target: **80–100 problems in December**
Daily time: **1.5–2 hours**

# 🎯 **December Goal Breakdown**

### **Week 1 (06–12 Dec)**

**Focus:** Recursion + Graphs Build-Up + Finish Leftovers

* Finish **Bit Manipulation** (1 problem)
* Finish **Strings Hard** (1 problem)
* Recursion → **8 problems** (patterns: subsets, permutations, partitions) ->
* Graphs → **6 problems** (BFS, DFS, cycle detection)
* Stack & Queue → **3 problems**

**Expected Progress:**
Recursion 18/25 • Graphs 29/54 • Stack&Queue 25/30

---

### **Week 2 (13–19 Dec)**

**Focus:** Graphs Heavy + DP Kickstart

* Graphs → **10 problems** (grid, islands, topo sort, bipartite)
* DP → **6 problems** (subset, knapsack, LIS base)
* Heaps → **3 problems**
* BST → **Finish last 3 problems**

**Expected Progress:**
Graphs 39/54 • DP 50/56 • BST 16/16 ✔

---

### **Week 3 (20–26 Dec)**

**Focus:** Dynamic Programming + Trees Cleanup

* DP → **6 hard problems** (LCS, matrix chain, partitions)
* Binary Trees → **Finish remaining 6**
* Heaps → **3 more**
* Stack & Queue → **finish remaining 5**

**Expected Progress:**
DP 56/56 ✔ • Trees 39/39 ✔ • Stack & Queue 30/30 ✔

---

### **Week 4 (27–31 Dec)**

**Focus:** Graphs Final Push + Tries + Cleanup

* Graphs → **10 remaining problems**
* Tries → **5 problems (complete)**
* 2–3 revision problems from BS, BT, DP
* 1–2 mock contests

**Expected Progress:**
Graphs 49–54/54 ✔ • Tries 7/7 ✔
