### üìà Monthly Projected Summary:

* **Total Problems Solved:** **$\approx 82$**
* **Topics Completed:** **6** (Sorting, Linked List, Sliding Window, BST, Strings, Stack & Queues)
* **Major Topics Nearing Completion:** **DP** (52/56) and **Binary Trees** (36/39)

This plan is medium-paced and allows you to finish a lot of material without burning out. Good luck!
