✅ MID-NOVEMBER (15 Days) DSA PLAN
🎯 Goal: Finish the “Almost Done” topics + Push 2 Major Topics (Graphs & DP)
🕒 Daily time needed: 1.5 hours max
📌 STEP 1 — FINISH HIGH-PROGRESS TOPICS (Very Fast Wins)

These will boost confidence and reduce your list instantly.

📍 Finish in Week 3 (Nov 15–21)
Topic	Current	Finish	Days needed
Arrays	31 / 40	→ 40/40	3 days ✅
Strings (Basic+Medium+Hard)	14/15 + 6/9	→ 24/24	2 days  3Q
BST	13 / 16	→ 16/16	2 days
🔥 Total: 7 days

These are 80% done; we finish them quickly.

📌 STEP 2 — MEDIUM-PROGRESS TOPICS
📍 Do in Week 4 (Nov 22–30)
Topic	Current	Target	Expected
Binary Search	19 / 32	→ 28/32	+9 problems
Bit Manipulation	9 / 18	→ 14/18	+5 problems
Stack & Queue	20 / 30	→ 26/30	+6 problems
Recursion	10 / 25	→ 16/25	+6 problems
🔥 Total: 15–20 problems in 8 days

This is achievable even during exams with only 1–1.5 hours/day

📌 STEP 3 — START THE BIG BOYS (Graphs + DP)

We won’t finish them in Nov because they are bulky.
But we will push progress.

⭐ Graphs (Main Goal for Next 3 months)

Current: 23 / 54
Target by Nov-end: 30 / 54

⭐ Dynamic Programming

Current: 44 / 56
Target by Nov-end: 48 / 56

Just solve 2 Graphs + 2 DP problems each week.
