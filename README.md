# 📘 Striver A2Z DSA Sheet — Completed

Welcome to my personal repository for the **Striver A2Z DSA Sheet**.  
This repository contains my **complete journey** of solving the entire sheet with **clean C++ implementations**, structured folders, and revision-friendly code.

This is not just a problem dump — it reflects **pattern-based learning, consistency, and completion**.

##  How I Approached the Sheet

- Focused on **patterns, not brute completion**
- Solved **10–12 problems per topic** deeply
- Emphasized:
  - Recursion → Graphs → DP flow
  - Search space thinking in Binary Search
  - Clean DFS/BFS mental models
- Revisited weak areas instead of skipping them

This repo is now mainly used for **revision and interview prep**.

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Language**: C++
- **IDE**: VS Code
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

---

##  Usage & Contribution

This repository is primarily for personal learning and revision, but:

-  Feel free to star it if you’re on the same journey
-  Suggestions to improve structure/readability are welcome

---

##  What’s Next

-  Structured revision & spaced repetition
-  Mixed-topic problem solving
-  Timed practice & contests
-  Interview-focused refinement

No new syllabus — only **sharpening**.
